How we record changes
-------------------------
Currently, we have swapped over to Sematic 2.0.0. This swap does not change previous versions (before 1.5.0). Version
numbers are represented in 3 digits, separated by periods (full stops). 

Sematic 2.0.0 Example
[x.y.z]

The first number (x) is a major change, often feature breaking or massive overhauls. Y is a minor change, without too much
effect on anything else. This could be a GUI change or a processing change. Finally, Z is a bug fix or slight patch. These
don't affect the user experience, but instead fix a bug or change how the software operates behind the scene, or in the 
background
